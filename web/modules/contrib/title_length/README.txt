# Node Title Length

## Introduction
The Node Title Length allows to change the length
of the node title field.

## Installation and configuration
By default, the module increases the field size
to 8000 characters.
If you want another size, you can change this value
before installing the module. To do this, you need
to create the following variable in the settings.php file.
$settings['node_title_length_chars'] = WANTED_SIZE;
